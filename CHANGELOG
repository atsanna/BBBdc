pcb v1.31, RTM v1, released Jan 11, 2015
    - Mostly minor tweaks to top and bottom silk screens
    - generated gerbers, ready to send off for mfg
schematic v2.3, released Jan 10, 2015
    - fixed jumper connections on eeprom, connected to A0/A1 instead of
      A1/A2
pcb v1.3 released Jan 10, 2015:
    - Flipped RTC module so it hangs over the ethernet jack
    - fixed eeprom traces to match schematic v2.3
    - changed 12V relay traces from 2mm to 1.5mm
    - change 5V relay traces to 0.5mm
    - re-arranged R1 to R5, cleaned up traces
    - spaced out congested traces above eeprom jumpers a bit better
    - Added copyright info on front and back silkscreens
pcb v1.21 released Jan 2, 2015:
    - added 3d models for footprints of push buttons, relays, and V7805 
pcb v1.2 released Dec 30, 2015:
    - refined component locations, traces
    - got rid of silk screen BBB perimeter
    - clean up silk screen labelling
pcb v1.11 released Dec 28, 2015:
    - first pass at traces finished, DRC check passes
    - silk screen cleanup & footprint placement alignment
    - Added pdf docs and 3d updated README pic
schematic v2.1, released Nov 28, 2015:
    - Added opto-isolators on pins for reading relay status
    - cleanup labels, etc. so ERC passes
    - Fix relay component picture so relays are disengaged
    - change relays to be AZ822 and attach compononent datasheet
